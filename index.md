Hi I'm John Lian. I'm a PM at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/) currently living in Seattle. Here's where I discuss some of my projects, showcase my (free!) photography work, and share contact information.

Before Microsoft, I studied at Mechanical Engineering at [McGill](http://www.mcgill.ca), where I 

- Interned at [Bombardier](http://commercialaircraft.bombardier.com/en/cseries.html) and [Suncor](http://www.suncor.com)
- Did research with [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/facultystaff/staff/andrewhiggins)
- Played in the [McGill Fight Band](http://www.fightband.com)
- Founded [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as the lead mentor

I'm a huge fan of [*FIRST* Robotics Competition (FRC)](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc). It's the best thing ever.
