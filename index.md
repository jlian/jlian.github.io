I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft. In my downtime I am an avid tourist, tech enthusiast, and wanna-be photographer. 

I recently graduated from McGill University. During my studies, I interned at Bombardier Aerospace and Suncor Energy. In addition, I was a researcher at the university's [SWPG lab](https://mcgill.ca/mecheng/research/researchlabs/swpg), and played in the [McGill Fight Band](http://www.mcgillathletics.ca/sports/2012/12/6/GEN_1206121625.aspx). Outside of school, I helped found [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as the lead coordinator. 

I just moved to Seattle!
