Thanks for visitng.

My name is John Lian aka 连冠伦. I currently live in Seattle and work at Microsoft as a PM. This website is where I discuss some of my projects, showcase my (free!) photography work, and share contact information.

Before Microsoft, I interned at Bombardier Aerospace and Suncor Energy as a student at McGill. In addition, I also did research with [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/facultystaff/staff/andrewhiggins), and played in the [McGill Fight Band](http://www.mcgillathletics.ca/sports/2012/12/6/GEN_1206121625.aspx). 

I'm a huge fan of *FIRST* Robotics Competition (FRC). I helped found [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as the lead mentor.
