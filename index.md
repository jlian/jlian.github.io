I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft, working on the Azure billing system. In my downtime I am an avid tourist, tech enthusiast, and wanna-be photographer. 

Before Microsoft, I interned at Bombardier Aerospace and Suncor Energy as a student at McGill. In addition, I also did research with [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/facultystaff/staff/andrewhiggins), and played in the [McGill Fight Band](http://www.mcgillathletics.ca/sports/2012/12/6/GEN_1206121625.aspx). 

I'm a huge fan of *FIRST* Robotics Competition (FRC). I helped found [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as the head mentor.
