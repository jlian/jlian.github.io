I am a mechanical engineering student studying at McGill University in Montreal. I enjoy technology, travelling, and gaming. I also love coffee but caffeine really keeps me up at night.

During my time in university, I interned at Bombardier and Suncor, did research at [SWPG](https://mcgill.ca/mecheng/researchlabs/swpg), and played in [McGill Fight Band](http://www.mcgillathletics.ca/sports/2012/12/6/GEN_1206121625.aspx). I also helped found [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as the lead coordinator.
