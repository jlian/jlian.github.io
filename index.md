Hi, I'm John. I work as a PM at [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/). Here's where I discuss some of my projects and share my (free!) photography work.

Before Microsoft, I studied at Mechanical Engineering at [McGill](http://www.mcgill.ca), where I 

- Interned at [Bombardier](http://commercialaircraft.bombardier.com/en/cseries.html) and [Suncor](http://www.suncor.com)
- Played in the [McGill Fight Band](http://www.fightband.com)
- Founded [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as the lead mentor
- Did research with [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/facultystaff/staff/andrewhiggins)

Now that I live in Seattle, I've been volunteering at [FRC Team 1983 Skunkworks Robotics](https://skunkworks.wildapricot.org) as a mechanical design mentor.
