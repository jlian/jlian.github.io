### Program Coordinator at FRC Team 4955 LA Tech

I helped Lakeside Academy form the team in the 2013/2014 FRC season. We went from having absolutely no experience in robotics to finishing *Ethel*, our first robot, in under two months. 

I served as the leader of the 30-person team responsible for integrating the Mechanical, Software, Electrical functions into our robots. In particular, I was most involved in the Mechanical side, completing most of the detail design using SolidWorks with custom as well as COTS parts. 

At the same time, I focused on long-term sustainability of the team by installing a positive team culture, creating a friendly environment, and helping members learn useful skills. Under my leadership, we went from zero to multi-function robot in one season, and saw 100% return rate the next.

#### *Ethel*

*Ethel* competed in the game [*Aerial Assist*](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2014-game). It can score in the both the high goal and and low goal reliably with its high-torque intake roller, pneumatic lifter, and spring-loaded launcher.

#### *Watson* 

*Watson* competed in [*Recycle Rush*](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2015-game). It can pick up and stack three totes and a bin. It has a reliable tote intake, a double geared motor elevator, and an encoder-based chain timing system.

### Simulating a One-Dimensional Gas With Suspended Magnets

I completed an honours mechanical engineering thesis under Prof. Andrew Higgins. It can be viewed [here](thesis.pdf). As a part of the the thesis, three projects were completed - listed below.

#### MATLAB Particle Tracker

With the help of open-source algorithms, I developed a user-friendly MATLAB application that could reliably and accurately track particles in video footages.

#### Magnets Suspension Device

We were able to suspend magnets using a air-bearing mechanism. This allowed free magnetic interaction without friction - a key requirement for the success of the study.

#### MATLAB Numerical Simulator for Nonlinear Interaction

I also developed a numerical simulator used to compare theoretical trajectories with ones observed with image analysis. I will clean up the code and host it on GitHub soon.

### Super Smashteroids

A silly little game we developed in Java. It has multi player and level progression.
