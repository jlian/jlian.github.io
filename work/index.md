### FRC Team 4955 LA Tech

I helped found the team in the 2013/2014 FRC season. I have since lead the development of the two robots: Ethel and Watson.

#### Ethel

Picks up balls and shoot!

#### Watson 

Picks up totes and stack them!

### Simulating a One-Dimensional Gas With Suspended Magnets

I completed an honours mechanical engineering thesis under Prof. Andrew Higgins. As parts of the the thesis, two projects were completed, listed below.

#### MATLAB Particle Tracking Application 

With the help of open-source algorithms, I developed a user-friendly MATLAB application that could reliably and accurately track particles in video footages. 

#### Magnets Suspension Device

We were able to suspend magnets using a air-bearing mechanism. This allowed free magnetic interaction without friction - a key requirement for the success of the study.
